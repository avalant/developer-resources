# Recommended Developer Resources
I will update this as I find and use resources that I believe to be of value. I'd describe myself as someone that learns best by seeing visual examples and most importantly, through the act of doing something myself. I hope that this list and my own quick reviews are helpful for someone.

## Learning

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) (Online Course)

> This is a Coursera course that breaks down literally, learning how to learn. It goes over how humans learn, methods to retain information, and the ways in which we stifle our learning process. It was helpful for me in understanding how to power through programming concepts that I often forgot or found myself frustrated with. This course also addresses procrastination and techniques for conquering it. I highly recommend going through this course before pursuing your programming studies.
