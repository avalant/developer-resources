## Subject: Learning

This is a Coursera course that breaks down literally, learning how to learn. It goes over how humans learn, methods to retain information, and the ways in which, we stifle our learning process. It was helpful for me in understanding how to power through programming concepts that I often forgot or found myself frustrated with.
